Steps and Observations:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset was imported using pandas from the provided URL.
The features of the dataset, excluding the 'quality' column, were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure that all features contribute equally to the PCA.
PCA Implementation:

PCA was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the standardized feature set to three principal components. This reduction helps in simplifying the analysis and visualization of high-dimensional data.
Visualization:

An interactive 3D scatter plot was created using plotly.express. The plot displays the first three principal components (PC1, PC2, and PC3) on the axes.
Different colors were used to represent different wine quality levels, allowing us to visualize how the quality of wine is distributed in the principal component space.
Insights:

The PCA transformation enabled us to reduce the dataset's complexity while retaining most of the variance.
The 3D scatter plot provides a clear visual representation of how different wine quality levels are positioned relative to each other in the reduced-dimensional space.
By analyzing the plot, one can observe the clustering or separation of wine samples based on their quality, which might reveal patterns or insights into how quality correlates with the features used.
The interactive plot helps in understanding the data structure and the impact of dimensionality reduction, facilitating easier interpretation and analysis of the dataset.
